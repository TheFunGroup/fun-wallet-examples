Apple can be used as a form of authentication for Fun Wallet.

Apple login will be done through a frontend interface. See an example project [here](https://github.com/TheFunGroup/fun-wallet-examples/tree/main/auth/social-login/react/apple).

The following shows creating a Fun Wallet with Apple Sign in a react app. When the `Login Fun Wallet with Apple` button is clicked, users will be redirected to Apple's sign in page. After they sign in, the Apple Account is used to create a Fun Wallet.
