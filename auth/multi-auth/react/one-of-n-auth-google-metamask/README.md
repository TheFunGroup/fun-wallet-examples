Multi-factor auth is the authentication of multiple sources. This means signing a wallet from any permutation of the possible sources.

See a full list of [sources](/guides/authenticate-wallet/set-authentication-source).

Both Metamask and Google are connected through frontend interfaces. We recommend refering to code in the full demo react app of `MultiAuthEoa` found [here](https://github.com/TheFunGroup/fun-wallet-examples/tree/main/auth/multi-auth/react/one-of-n-auth-google-metamask).
