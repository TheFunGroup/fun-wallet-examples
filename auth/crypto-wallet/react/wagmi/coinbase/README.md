[Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) can be used as a form of authentication for Fun Wallet.


Coinbase connect will be done through a frontend interface. See an example project [here](https://github.com/TheFunGroup/fun-wallet-examples/tree/main/auth/crypto-wallet/react/wagmi/coinbase).

The following shows creating a Fun Wallet with Coinbase Wallet in a react app. When the Coinbase wallet button is clicked, users will be prompted to connect their Coinbase Wallet. After they connect their wallet, the eoa from their wallet is used to create a Fun Wallet.
